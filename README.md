Food Delivery Platform Backend
This project is a backend system for a food delivery platform, similar to "Zomato". It includes user management, restaurant and menu management, order placement, and real-time order tracking using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB (NoSQL database).

Features
User Management: Register, login, update profile, and manage delivery addresses.
Restaurant & Menu Management: Add and update restaurants and menu items.
Order Placement: Place orders, track their status, and view order history.
Real-Time Order Tracking: Receive real-time updates on order statuses using WebSockets.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
Languages: JavaScript
Environment Variables: Managed using dotenv

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Food-Delivery-Backend.git
cd Food-Delivery-Backend
Install dependencies:
bash
npm install
Set up MongoDB:
Make sure you have a MongoDB instance running locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Configure the connection string in your .env file (see below).

Start the server:
bash
npm start
The server will run on the port specified in your .env file or default to port 3000.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

bash
`PORT=3000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/foodDelivery
    JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey`

    PORT: Port on which the server runs.
    MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string.
    JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication.

API Endpoints
User Management
POST /user/register: Register a new user.
POST /user/login: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
GET /user/profile: Get the logged-in user’s profile (requires JWT token).
PUT /user/profile: Update user profile (requires JWT token).
Restaurant & Menu Management
POST /restaurants: Create a new restaurant.
PUT /restaurants/:restaurantId: Update restaurant details.
POST /restaurants/:restaurantId/menu: Add items to a restaurant’s menu.
PUT /restaurants/:restaurantId/menu/:itemId: Update a specific menu item.
Order Placement
POST /orders: Place a new order (requires JWT token).
GET /orders: Get a list of the logged-in user’s orders (requires JWT token).
GET /orders/:orderId: Get details of a specific order.
PUT /orders/:orderId/status: Update order status (requires JWT token).
Real-Time Order Tracking

    GET /orders/:orderId/track: Track the status of a specific order (requires JWT token).
    Used WebSockets for Real-Time Updates Real-time order tracking is implemented using WebSockets with Socket.IO. When an order’s status is updated, connected clients receive real-time notifications. The server broadcasts order status updates to all connected clients.

To track an order in real-time:

Connect to the WebSocket server.
Listen for orderStatus events with the following payload:

{
"orderId": "order-id",
"status": "order-status"
}
Testing
You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the API endpoints.

Register a new user using the /user/register endpoint.
Authenticate using /user/login and save the JWT token.
Use the token in subsequent requests to create restaurants, menus, and place orders.
Connect to the WebSocket server for real-time updates.
Scalability & Optimization
NoSQL Optimization: MongoDB is used with proper indexing for fast querying on frequently accessed fields like email and order status.
JWT for Authentication: Secure and stateless authentication.
Horizontal Scaling: The system can be horizontally scaled by adding more application instances behind a load balancer. WebSocket connections can be managed using solutions like Redis for scaling real-time updates across instances.
